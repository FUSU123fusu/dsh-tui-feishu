/**
 * Feishu interactive-card builders plus the throttled streaming-card
 * pipeline.
 *
 * One card per turn: POST it when the turn starts, then repeatedly
 * `im.v1.message.patch` the same message as output arrives. Patching is
 * silent (no unread notification) - exactly right for intermediate progress.
 * Patches are throttled and coalesced: at most one patch in flight per card
 * and the newest snapshot always wins.
 *
 * Card layout is v1 (root `elements`, no `schema` field) - the only layout
 * that supports interactive callback buttons together with message.patch.
 *
 * Refactored from PGZXB/dsh-feishu (MIT).
